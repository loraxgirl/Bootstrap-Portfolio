                <img src="assets/images/March2020.png" style="float:left; padding: 0px 20px 8px 2px;"> <h6><p>In my 20s I became interested in web design, and started making sites for friends' projects, like bands and art portfolios.  This hobby quickly became a passion, and soon I was designing intranet sites for departments at Hughes Space and Communications.  I would never have guessed that playing on my computer would lead me to learning about (and walking around!) satellites.  My experience at Hughes was wonderful, but big changes came when that division was sold to Boeing.</p>
                
                <p>While I waited to see what my fate would be with Boieng, a headhunter approached me about another web design position.  This was an exciting opportunity, and soon I was the Lead HTML Developer for ticketmaster.com.  At the time, ticketmaster.com was a separate company from Ticketmaster corporate, and it was a very different environment.  Located in the ground floor of an office building in Pasadena, ticketmaster.com was a small, lean company with forward-thinking executives and a crew of people who honestly loved their jobs. When ticketmaster.com merged with Ticketmaster Corporate, we all moved to the Wilshire Boulevard location.  I still loved web design, and my job, but this move was the harbinger for more big changes.</p>
                
                <p>Moving to a trailer house (a company that works on film/tv trailers) I started branching out and began learning film editing, graphic design and technical support for computers and Avid machines.  Eventually I left Los Angeles for family reasons, and this move brought me into real estate marketing, where I could use my graphic design and web design skills.</p>
            
                <p>Now I am circling back around, and am enrolled in the UCLA Extension Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp, where I am learning more about the back end of web design.  This is an exciting change for me, and when it is completed I will be a very experienced, well-rounded developer.</p></h6></div>
